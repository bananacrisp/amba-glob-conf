    <p>Try to begin the application process a year before you would like to start at Business School. In most countries, applying to university is a simple matter that requires a day or two of thought and effort. How well or poorly you write your application has little impact upon your admission results. MBA applications are fundamentally different. They require substantial effort, and your skill at marketing yourself will be a major determinant of your admission success.</p>

    <img class="thumbnail" src="../img/image_l_mock_v_2.jpg">

    <h4>Selling Yourself</h4>
    <p>Because MBA applications require you to submit a slew of material – essays, recommendations, references, CV, standardised test results (GMAT or GRE), lengthy descriptions of your work experience, and so on – and probably an interview as well, you have lots of opportunity to impress. You can do this in several ways: ‘position’ yourself, taking full advantage of who you are, what you’ve achieved, and where you are heading. Take advantage of the opportunity to present your objective data – credentials and experience – in their most favourable light. Consider how to show off your strengths and minimise your weaknesses. And best of all, tell your story: the character arc that describes how you have reached where you are currently, including what you’ve learned about yourself and the world, and how you are planning to take advantage of this, once you’ve acquired your MBA. To ensure that all the components of your MBA application refl ect your skills, aptitudes, and story, follow the tips below.</p>

    <h4>Basic Online Forms</h4>
    <p>Pay attention to how you present yourself in the basic online forms (where you describe your career and educational history and respond to short-answer questions). Take care that what you say here is consistent with how you are presented in the essays, interviews, and recommendations. Don’t overlook the opportunity to advance your case by showing, for example, the steady increase in your responsibilities and accomplishments.</p>

    <h4>Essays</h4>
    <p>If you rely on your ‘numbers’ (GMAT score, undergraduate record, salary) to achieve admittance to Business School, you will be missing the opportunity to improve your chances dramatically. In fact, the better the School, the more likely it is that the objective data in your application will not determine your fate, and that your essays will weigh heavily in the decision. Admissions offi cers will judge you on the basis of what your essays reveal about your writing ability (including your ability to persuade, structure, and maintain a well-reasoned argument, and communicate in an interesting and professional manner); honesty and maturity; understanding of what the programme offers and requires and how well you would contribute to it; and clear (believable) ideas about where you are heading. They want to learn what you have accomplished, who you are as a person, and how well you can communicate. Thus, essays offer the chance to show Schools who you are. Take advantage of this opportunity. Referees can show only a part of who you are, since most of them are employers and have only seen you in one context. Similarly, interviews are not under your control to the same extent as your essays, which can be re-examined to make sure the ‘best you’ is presented. Your essays should present a clear picture of you, but they do not need to tell all. Sketching in the main points with appropriate stories will show who you are. In fact, whenever possible, try to tell a story rather than write an essay. The task will seem lighter. This is your chance to choose which parts of yourself to highlight and to determine how people should view them. This is a precious opportunity: take advantage of the chance to colour your readers’ interpretations.</p>

    <h4>Recommendations</h4>
    <p>Schools generally ask for references from two referees. It is usually best to obtain both recommendations from employers or colleagues, who can address most of the key issues, rather than from former professors, who can seldom add much to the picture that emerges from your university transcript.</p>

    <img class="thumbnail" src="../img/image_l_mock_v_1.jpg">

    <h4>There are three cardinal rules that should be remembered when choosing your referees:</h4>

    <h4>Rule 1:</h4>
    <p>choose people who know you well. Don’t select people who are famous or infl uential if they are unable to discuss your candidacy and performance in detail. Instead, choose people who can make the recommendation credible by illustrating their points with anecdotes that show you at your best.</p>

    <h4>Rule 2:</h4>
    <p>choose people who genuinely like you – they will take the time to write a polished, carefully considered recommendation.</p>

    <h4>Rule 3:</h4>
    <p>choose people who can address more than one of the key subjects: your intellectual ability, your managerial and leadership potential, your personal attributes, and your career plan. It’s often worth scheduling formal meetings with your referees, and providing them with written information about your goals and reminders of your accomplishments. At a minimum, explain why you are seeking an MBA, why you have chosen the Schools you have, and your application strategy. You might also give them an outline of what you want discussed, including the examples that you think best demonstrate your capabilities and performance.</p>

    <hr>

    <h4>Interviews</h4>
    <p>Interviews offer Schools an ideal opportunity to learn much more about you. Some things are not readily apparent without a face-to-face meeting, such as your charm, persuasiveness, presence, and business manner. The greater emphasis upon soft skills in MBA programmes means that personality and social skills are considered more important than they were in the past. Interviews also provide an opportunity to probe any areas that were insuffi ciently explained in the application</p>


    <h4>Application Timing</h4>
    <p>Most applicants underestimate the amount of time a successful MBA application requires. The reality is that many of the necessary steps are very time consuming. For example, contacting referees, briefi ng them, and allowing them time to write a recommendation will take weeks (or months) rather than days. Timing is particularly important when you apply to several Schools rather than just one. Try to begin the application process a year before you would like to start at Business School. Therefore, if you anticipate beginning in September, you would be wise to start getting your material together in June of the preceding year. Business Schools generally require applications to be submitted from three to eight months before the start of the programme. Apply as early in each School’s application cycle as you can, unless you expect your credentials to improve dramatically later in the application period.</p>


    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    <p>Succeeding in the MBA application process requires strategic thinking, sound planning, organisational skills, persuasive ability and lots of hard work; in other words, it is good training for the MBA itself.</p>


    <h4>Further reading</h4>
    <p>Consult the companion article on page 18 or, for more in-depth advice, consult my book How to Get Into the Top MBA Programs (Prentice Hall), or email me at rmontauk@aol.com for individual consulting. Richard Montauk is the author of How to Get Into the Top MBA Programs, currently in its sixth edition. The book, a bestseller in multiple countries, is generally regarded as the most analytical and comprehensive guide to the Business School application process. It is based in part on his 25+ years of consulting to applicants and, in part, on his in-depth interviews with the admissions and career service deans at the world’s top Business Schools.</p>
